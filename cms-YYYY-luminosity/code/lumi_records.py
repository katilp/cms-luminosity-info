Create a luminosity record.
Input arguments
- recid (May 2023, the last used recid was 1055 for 2015 pp)
- year to be released
- run era (for pp, give one of the released eras, it is needed to get the collision energy, stored per era)
- type (pp, pPb, pphiref, PbPb)

Inputs:
- 2013 pPb: 1056 2013 HIRun2013 pPb
- 2013 ppref: 1057 2013 Run2013A pphiref
- 2015 ppref: 1058 2015 Run2015E pphiref
- 2015 pp: 1055 2015 Run2015D pp (not used to build the current record, but tested to produce the same files)
